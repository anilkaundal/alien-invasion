# Alien Invasion :rocket:
In this project, I have used Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the
aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen in levels
that increase in speed and difficulty.

#### Screenshot

#### Controls
- Use `spacebar` to shoot bullets.
- Use `left-right arrow keys` to move the ship.
- Use `q` to quit the game.
